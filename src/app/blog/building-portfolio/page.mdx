# Building My Portfolio Website

*March 15, 2024*

When I decided to build my portfolio website, I wanted to create something that was not only visually appealing but also technically sound and easy to maintain. Here's a deep dive into how I built it using Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## The Tech Stack

I chose my tech stack based on three main criteria:
- Performance
- Developer Experience
- Maintainability

### Next.js
I opted for Next.js because it offers:
- Built-in routing
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Great developer experience
- Excellent TypeScript support

### TypeScript
TypeScript was a no-brainer for me because it provides:
- Type safety
- Better IDE support
- Easier refactoring
- Fewer runtime errors

### TailwindCSS
For styling, TailwindCSS was my choice because:
- It's highly customizable
- Provides excellent developer experience
- Results in smaller bundle sizes
- Makes responsive design easier

## Key Features

### Project Cards
One of the main features I wanted was a clean way to showcase my projects. I created a card component that displays:
- Project title
- Description
- Technologies used
- Links to GitHub and live demos
