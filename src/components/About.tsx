                    Hi, I'm Oliver. I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a B.S. in 
                    Artificial Intelligence + Statistics & Machine Learning.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about machine learning, data science, and software development. 
                    Currently, I work as a Teaching Assistant for Principles of Imperative Computation,
                    CMU's data structures & algorithms course, and serve as the VP of Finance for the 
                    CMU Data Science Club.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My interests span from developing novel applications of ML to building efficient 
                    backend systems. I enjoy tackling complex problems and creating solutions that 
                    make a meaningful impact.
