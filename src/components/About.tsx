                    Hi, I&apos;m Oliver. I&apos;m a student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a B.S. in 
                    Artificial Intelligence + Statistics & Machine Learning.

                    During the summer of 2025, I was a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon.
                    I also worked as a Teaching Assistant for CMU&apos;s Principles of Imperative 
                    Computation course and serve as Director of Competitions for the CMU Data Science Club.

                    My interests span from building efficient backend systems to the specific field
                    of multimodal learning. I enjoy tackling complex problems and creating 
                    solutions that make a meaningful impact.
