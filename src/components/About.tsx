                    Hi, I&apos;m Oliver. I&apos;m a student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a B.S. in 
                    Artificial Intelligence + Statistics & Machine Learning.

                <p>
                    I&apos;m passionate about machine learning, data science, and software development. 
                    Currently, I work as a Teaching Assistant for CMU&apos;s Principles of Imperative 
                    Computation course and serve as VP of Finance for the CMU Data Science Club.

                    My interests span from developing novel ML applications to building efficient 
                    backend systems. I enjoy tackling complex problems and creating solutions that 
                    make a meaningful impact.
